# Challenge-1
## description
It was necessary to change the semantics of the Html to improve the accesability of the web page and make it easier for other developers.
I built this project to learn HTML semantics (and to not fail too).
problems that were solved include: poor Html semantics, disfunctional links, lack of accesability. 
I learned different html tags, how to implement navigational links, and ad alt tags to images.
